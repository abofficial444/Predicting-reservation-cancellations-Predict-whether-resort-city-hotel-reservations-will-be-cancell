Customers cancelling reservations severely impact the results of hotels and dining facilities. It not only damages revenue, but also wastes the food in stock and personnel expenses used to provide services.  The goal of this competition is to use data consisting of over 100,000 reservations to categorize reservations into those that will and will not be cancelled. The data uses actual reservations that were made in several cities across Portugal. This is a challenge that predicts cancellations. Itâ€™s also very meaningful for society because it can later be used for various purposes such as analyzing the causes behind the cancellations.  Since the data is in chronological order, you will be able to learn data processing methods that can be applied in various fields.
